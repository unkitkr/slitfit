Task:
Description
Bitly is an application to help you with the short URLs. 
Let's say you have a URL. You need to send that URL in an SMS. You will be having a character 
limit for SMS. So it would be nice to shorten your URL to something smaller. 


Example:
Actual URL: https://surveysparrow.com/features/create-a-survey/
Shortened URL: https://bit.ly/34uqMpV


Requirements:
Develop an ability to shorten URLs.
Upon opening the shortened URL, redirect to long URL

Nice to have:
1. User should be able to login to his account
2. Users can generate multiple short URLs.
3. Once the user logs in, he should be able to see the list of short URLs he has generated.   

Must dos:
1. Push your code to a repository in Github. 
2. Host your application somewhere(Heroku, Netlify or something that you know) and
   then it should be accessible through the browser by a URL.
3. Once you have finished your application, with the Github repo URL and your application URL send us 
   an email to divya@surveysparrow.com, cmb@surveysparrow.com.



Learnings:

1. Why need shortning services:
   a. Texting/microbloging platforms have limited number of characters.
   b. URLs look more intutive

2. URL hashing and mappings:
   a. Long URLs need to be converted into short URLs and redirected back to original URLs.
   b. There must not be any kind of collision between the key generated for a long URL with other URLs.
   c. Rather than using a direct hashing we can use the ID provided by the database.

3. Short commings:
   1. Database UUIDs:
    a. Using a database generated UUID will not serve the purpose since it's 36 characters long.
    b. Use of UUID can be proven as counter intutive. (pqr.xyz/xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.... doesn't look good.
    c. The space consumed in the database to store those links will be considerably high.
   2. Database AUTO INCREMENT integer primary key.
    a. Although this looks a promising solution as, low memory consumption (4bytes integer),
       also, pqr.xyz/<int> looks great but it can lead to a potential failure while merging/migrating database.
    b. This would limit the user capability to choose an intutive URL. (pqr.xyz/1 vs pqr.xyz/companyname)
